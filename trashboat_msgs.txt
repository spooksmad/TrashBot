the new maps are actually really good tbh
It might just be cus i ain't played kart in a fat minute but im finding them fun asf atm
i got snes mario circuit
people say the map is mid cus it's basic
i find it fun
banging ost aswell
then again i play     so that's what makes it fun mostly
i can imagine it being wank on like    cc in online
the thing i like about these dlc maps is that they've actually designed them with    200cc in mind
so you don't just go flying off the track or hitting walls     
even the tour maps
yeah
yeah
waluigi pinball is such a good looking map now
one of the tour maps they added aswell is actually pretty good
this whole wave was a W
much better than the first
me to myself in the mirror after preaching all these years to bring back waluigi pinball and claiming how good i was at mariokart DS only to get washed in online and place   th everytime the map gets voted

madvillainy is such a good album
genuinely becoming probably my favourite album ever
everything is so well orchestrated
every song flows together so well
and the production is phenomenal
it's got a more chill theme to it but the songs are so good
yeah
one of my favourites is raid
strange ways is a good one
fancy clown aswell
ight
innit
shit's iconic
fr
oh yeah meat grinder goes crazy
it really sucks that he died man honestly
think last year
his death is so interesting tho
cus he was mad private about his life
to this day nobody knows how he died
don't even know where the grave is
he died in october but it was announced in like december
his friends didn't even know he died until the announcement
bro went out like a real villain
shit he could be still alive somewhere who knows bruh
the beat is fucking insane
fr
the beats are legit made for him
like i couldn't hear anyone else on these
which is pretty sick aswell cus people mix his verses on other beats and they usually sound better than the originals lmao
go to      
this is a kanye beat with the meat grinder verse on it
fairs
a couple other albums i'd recommend is operation doomsday  vaudelaire villain  MM  FOOD and take me to your leader
if i ever get baked to a song it's gonna be america's most blunted
vaudelaire villain and take me to your leader are under different names to doom but they should be easy to find
gang weed anthem
but yeah the mf doom rabbithole goes crazy and i don't regret getting indulged
it's really sick that his music has been rediscovered tho
it's aged so well
fr
wish i discovered him earlier
fr
I've always knew about him but like never really took a proper listen
i have no regrets
since i listen to alot of music at work i've been kind've trying different shit aswell
doom was one of them
I still need to listen to his later stuff aswell tbh
i've heard a couple good songs here and there but i need to sit down and actually listen to the albums
oh another album btw
mouse & the mask
is really good lmao
i need to relisten tho
ricegum x mf doom collab 
figaro is a good underrated one
it don't really get talked about much but it's really good

like doom's songs i can't hear anyone else being able to pull of but his own verses can work on so much
his rapping ability is insane lmao
like the album with this beat came out in like      i think
this verse is from      lmao
fr
the fact we never got an official doom and kanye collab hurts man lmao
 how many people entered that door?
